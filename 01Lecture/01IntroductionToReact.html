    <h2>What is React, and Its Role in Web Development?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast,
        interactive user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications
        (SPAs)
      </li>
      <li>
        It allows developers to build UIs by breaking them down into small,
        reusable pieces called components.
      </li>
      <li>
        React is often used in web development to manage and update the user
        interface of a web application in response to user actions, without
        needing to reload the whole page.
      </li>
      <li>
        In web development, React plays a crucial role in creating dynamic
        applications with high performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rather than directly manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), which
        can be slow, React uses a "virtual DOM."
      </li>
      <li>
        This approach lets React efficiently update only the parts of the
        interface that need to change, enhancing speed and responsiveness.
      </li>
      <li>
        This makes React particularly suitable for complex, interactive web
        applications, where user interaction is frequent and requires immediate
        feedback.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>History of React</h2>
    <p>
      => The story of React began at Facebook as the company searched for a way to
      improve the user experience on its growing platform.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. </li>
      <li>He developed React in 2011 as a way to improve the performance and efficiency of building UIs, especially for Facebookâ€™s news feed and Instagram. </li>
      <li>React was open-sourced in 2013, allowing the wider development community to contribute to its growth and adoption.</li>
      <li>React has been maintained by Facebook (now Meta), along with contributions from a large community of developers.</li>
    </ul>
