# Theoretical questions and answers based on the first React lecture:

1. What is React?

> React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces (UIs), especially for single-page applications. It helps you create dynamic and interactive web pages by breaking down the UI into reusable components. These components can manage their own state and render the UI based on that state.

2. How does React help in web development?

> React helps developers build efficient and fast websites by using a Virtual DOM to update only parts of the page that change. This makes React apps faster and more responsive compared to traditional websites that reload the entire page. It also lets developers build reusable components, making code easier to maintain and scale.

3. What is the history of React?

> React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, in 2011. It was initially developed for use in Facebook’s newsfeed and Instagram. React was open-sourced by Facebook in 2013, which allowed developers all around the world to use it and contribute to its growth. Since then, it has become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building web applications.

4. What are some key features of React?

=> Some of the key features of React are:

> Component-Based Architecture: React allows you to break down the UI into reusable components, which makes development faster and more organized.

> Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance by updating only the changed parts of the page.

> Declarative Syntax: React lets you describe how the UI should look based on the state, and React takes care of updating the DOM when the state changes.

> Unidirectional Data Flow: Data in React flows in one direction, making it easier to track and manage.

5. Why is React so popular?

> React is popular because it’s easy to learn, efficient in updating the UI, and helps build large-scale applications. Its component-based structure makes code reusable and maintainable. React also has a huge community of developers, which makes it easy to find resources and support. Plus, with React Native, you can build mobile apps using the same knowledge.
