1. What is create-react-app and why is it useful?

> Answer: create-react-app is a tool that helps you quickly set up a new React project without needing to worry about complex configurations. It automatically creates all the necessary files and sets up important tools like Webpack and Babel for you. This makes it easier to start coding your React app without spending time on setting things up.


2. What does the index.html file do in a React app?

> Answer: The index.html file is like the shell of your React app. It contains the basic HTML structure, and React will inject your entire app into the <div> element inside this file (which has the id "root"). You donâ€™t usually change this file, but React uses it as the place to show everything you build with React.


3. What is the role of the src/index.jsx file in a React app?

> Answer: The src/index.jsx file is the starting point of your React app. It tells React where to display the app by linking to the index.html file and rendering the main App component. Whenever you run the app, this is the first file that gets executed, and it makes sure everything shows up on the screen.


4. What is the purpose of the src/components/ folder in a React project?

> Answer: The src/components/ folder is where you store smaller, reusable pieces of your app, called "components." For example, you might have a component for a button or a header. By keeping all your components organized in this folder, it's easier to reuse them in different parts of the app and keep your code clean and simple.


5. What happens when you run npm run dev in a React project?

> Answer: When you run npm run dev, it starts a development server on your computer and opens your app in the browser. This server watches for changes in your code, so whenever you make edits, it automatically refreshes the page and shows the updates. It's like having a live preview of your app while you work on it.
